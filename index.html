		I was bored one day and wanted to explore making an ant hill simulation.<br>
		I came up with this in about 4 hours.<br><br>
		There are plenty of bugs, but for now I'm happy with it<br>
		The end goal was to have something interesting to watch as the ants built a colony<br><br>
		
		What I would add if I had more time to mess with it:<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tunnels that loop back to eachother (right now it's just a tree)<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support tunnels making it back to surface (right now there's just one entry point and no tunnels can go back up certain elevation)<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add rooms that would have to be built after so much distance from the nearest room/surface point
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support more than the 8 secondary directions
    <br><br>
    I've made a 2nd version, with many of the same bugs, but better engine <a href="./v2">here</a>
